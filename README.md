# Treadstone
A ReactJS dashboard that receives its data via a web socket.

I was wondering what a client server react app backed by nodejs would look like so I started this project and I called 
it Treadstone.

Head over to the [Live Demo](http://treadstone.jonlailam.net) to see it in action.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/jonboylailam/treadstone.git 
cd treadstone
npm install
gulp
browse to http://localhost:3000
```

## Creating a bundle.tar.gz
```
gulp bundle
```
