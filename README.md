# Treadstone
A ReactJS dashboard that receives its data via a web socket.

I was wondering what a client server react app backed by nodejs would look like so I started this project and I called 
it treadstone.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/jonboylailam/treadstone.git 
cd treadstone
npm install
gulp
browse to http://localhost:3000
```
